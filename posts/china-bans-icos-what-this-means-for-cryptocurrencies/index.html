<blockquote>
  <p>UPDATE 1 (Sept 5): Yunbi delists ICO tokens, QTUM, GXS, EOS, ANS, DGD, 1ST, GNT, REP, SNT, OMG, PAY, LUN, VEN. There’s a rumour that Yunbi is under police investigation and wants to distance itself from ICOs as much as possible.<br />
UPDATE 2 (Sept 6): Other Chinese exchanges are also delisting ICO tokens (Bter, Yuanbao, Jubi, btc9 etc). QTUM and NEO most likely affected as well.<br />
UPDATE 3 (Sept 7): There’s a <a href="http://boxmining.com/china-ico-ban-temporary-will-introduce-licensing-soon/">rumour</a> spreading around that a Chinese government regulatory official has stated on CCTV that the ICO ban is only temporary until the government can introduce licensing rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/3374222/index.html">China just banned ICOs</a>. The government has put an end to all planned and ongoing ICOs. Even completed ICOs, but that have not started trading, are being forced to refund all proceeds. China is a huge market for crpytocurrencies and ICOs have been a major factor in driving demand. Now that the Chinese ICO market has vanished overnight, the cryptocurrency market reacted violently and this has left many people in disarray.</p>

<p>This news caused both Bitcoin and Ethereum to fall dramatically and its an even worse bloodbath in the altcoins market. Chinese cryptocurrencies have been hit especially hard. For example, HShares, Binance Coin, and Walton have lost 55.94%, 53.22%, and 39.28% in value respectively 24 hours after the announcement according to coinmarketcap.com. Emerging Chinese smart contract platforms have also been hit hard. NEO has dropped 38% in value while QTUM dropped 28.31%.</p>

<p>Obviously, in the short term this news has drastic consequences for the market but what about the medium to long term? How will it affect ICO platform cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, QTUM and NEO over the next few weeks and months? What about store of value cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Litecoin? Here’s what I think will happen.</p>

<h1 id="ethereum">Ethereum</h1>

<p>A pessimist might think Ethereum’s price will be suppressed in the long term since there is less demand for it when there are less ICOs. Keep in mind that China’s ICO market is huge. There are sometimes thousands of ICOs occurring at once. Most of them, obviously, are nothing more than scams. But you can see that when China spots an opportunity, it goes all out. When mobile apps were huge, apps were popping up in China by the millions.</p>

<p>I disagree with this analysis. Most scam Chinese ICOs will usually cash out of their raised Ethereum anyways which actually increases selling pressure. What many don’t realize in the midst of this short term market crash is that this is actually hugely positive news for cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The ICO engine is unsustainable and very unhealthy. Sure it fuels the fire and bloats everyone’s portfolio in the short term but in the long run as many ICOs turn out to be scams, people will lose a lot more money than gain and this not only burns people out of the market, it gives cryptocurrencies a bad name. By stopping scammy ICOs in their tracks, the Chinese government is actually doing cryptocurrencies a huge favour.</p>

<p>Some people consider this another August 1st even, when the cryptocurrency market tumbled for several days before August 1st due to uncertainty from a possible Bitcoin hardfork (BIP 148). I don’t think this is even close to an August 1st event. There was a ton of uncertainty leading up to August 1st. There is no uncertainty with this news. We know exactly what happened - China banned ICOs - and the markets (over)reacted appropriately. The large initial drops were expected but I can’t see a sustained bear market.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are still legal in China and the government is embracing blockchain technology. With more integrity in the cryptocurrency market, I can even see greater institutional investor participation post Chinese ICO-ban. Ethereum, especially with Metropolis coming up, will be fine and continue chugging along in the mid-to-long term.</p>

<h1 id="qtum">QTUM</h1>

<p>There is a lot less certainty for QTUM in the short and mid term, though I’m still confident in the project in the long term. QTUM was hit one of the hardest after the news was announced. This is mostly because QTUM is a budding Chinese smart contract platform and there are many many new projects building on QTUM. Patrick Dai (one of QTUM’s founders), hinted that there are in fact 17 projects building on QTUM right now. 4 of them have been officially announced. One of them, Energo, had recently completed its ICO and is one of the projects being forced to refund their customer’s funds. Unfortunately, most of the 17 projects are Chinese projects and will be relying on the Chinese market to raise funds via ICO. With the ICO option out, many of these projects will flounder or even get killed right out of the gates and QTUM will have a lot less going for it. Keep in mind that this is just speculation and a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aZ2I0HU6Q6i8bTymWp0iKQ">press release</a> from the QTUM Foundation in reaction to the Chinese government’s ruling on ICOs continues to affirm that there are still 17 projects on QTUM.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are still plenty of positive things going on for QTUM. It’s technology, as I’ve reiterated many times, is extremely strong and in time, there will be many non-Chinese companies building on QTUM. In fact, Blocksafe, a United States company, is planning to move their $TRIG token over to QTUM’s platform once the main net releases. On the topic of the main net, it will be released on September 13th which is also very exciting for QTUM. QTUM will move from an ERC token to an actual blockchain with dApps and proof of stake and DGP.</p>

<p>Although the news that the Chinese government is banning ICOs is a huge hit to QTUM’s momentum going into the main net release, it really only affects QTUM in the short and mid term. In the long term I am quite confident that QTUM will become a strong challenger to Ethereum.</p>

<p>In fact, it’s definitely a possibility that the Chinese government will legalise ICOs again (albeit with tighter regulations), which will be very very positive news for QTUM.</p>

<h1 id="neo">NEO</h1>

<p>NEO, like QTUM, was hit particularly hard. Like QTUM, NEO is a budding Chinese smart contract platform. Although NEO has signficantly less projects building on it than QTUM (at this moment, only 2 are known), it’s investors still have expectations that there should be more projects building on NEO in the future and without the Chinese market, these expectations have been drastically cut short.</p>

<p>Many who follow my Twitter account know that I don’t have particularly great opinions on NEO after it’s August 8th release. I maintain my stance that NEO will still fare poorly in the mid and long term. If even Chinese projects have been avoiding NEO, I can’t see much international adoption.</p>

<h1 id="stratis-and-waves">Stratis and Waves</h1>

<p>Stratis and Waves are budding smart contract platforms outside of China. Stratis is from the United Kingdom and Waves is from Russia.</p>

<p>Both were badly hit immediately after the news was released, though not as bad as NEO and QTUM. In fact, both simply fell to their previous daily support levels. As NEO and QTUM fell 30-40%, Stratis and Waves both fell about 15%.</p>

<p>I’m inclined to say China banning ICOs is really a non-event for both platforms in the mid to long term. The international ICO market is still going strong and both will be targeting the international market. It’s hard to see any Chinese projects that intended to or is intending to build on Stratis or Waves anytime soon.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for Stratis in the long term as a platform, as I’m not familiar with its technology, but I’m incredibly bullish on Waves. I’ve been doing a lot of research on Waves’s technology and I have as much confidence in it as I do with QTUM’s. Additionally, the Russian government is very blockchain-friendly and this is reflected in the adoption of blockchain technology by many large Russian corporations. For example, Burger King Russia recently issued the WhopperCoin on the Waves network and Russian airline S7, backed by Russia’s Alfa-bank, started selling tickets in Ethereum in July.</p>

<p>Stratis and Waves are looking good in the mid term and I’m incredibly bullish for Waves’s long term prospects.</p>

<h1 id="omisego-and-tenx">OmiseGo and TenX</h1>

<p>Both OmiseGo and TenX are not Chinese projects not are they smart contract platforms. Both are cryptocurrency-based payment solutions and China banning ICOs is definitely a non-event for them. In the short term, they were hurt as the crpytocurrency market contracted out of fear but everything fell after the news was released. Unless this news somehow triggers a prolonged bear market, I don’t see any problems for both platforms in the mid-to-long term as a result of this news. However, I can’t really for price trends as a result of any other factors since I haven’t done enough research on both.</p>

<h1 id="bitcoin-and-litecoin">Bitcoin and Litecoin</h1>

<p>Bitcoin and Litecoin are not smart contract platforms and this banning of Chinese ICOs is mostly a non-event for both. Again, like Ethereum, one could argue that there will be less demand for them since there are less ICOs but many scammy ICOs in China immediately cash out their raised funds anyways.</p>

<p>Yes, Bitcoin and Litecoin were hurt in the short term, but that’s just with fiat leaving the crypto market from the initial market panic. With the dust settled, expect more optimism for both store of value cryptocurrencies than ever before. ICOs are one of the best things about smart contract platforms and this Chinese government ruling definitely cooled much of the hype for them.</p>

<p>Like I’ve stated above, the current market situation is very different from the bear market leading up to August 1st. That bear market was a result of uncertainty with a possible Bitcoin hard fork. In this case, there is no uncertainty and it’s hard to see another prolonged bear market as a result of this news. Additionally, I do think that the Chinese government’s banning of ICOs is actually very healthy for cryptocurrencies as a whole in the long term. There will definitely be increased confidence with less scammers in the scene and we can expect greater institutional investor participation in the market.</p>

<p>I’m bullish on both Bitcoin and Litecoin in the mid-to-long term. In fact, I’m bullish for cryptocurrencies as a whole after this news.</p>

        <p>In July 2010, one bitcoin was worth $0.08 USD. Today, one bitcoin is worth $2500 USD. Bitcoin's meteoric growth has pushed cryptocurrencies from an obscure niche to the mainstream, and created fortunes along the way. Store Of Value is a blog that will help you navigate the cryptocurrency world. As an avid crypto researcher and a crypto day-trader, I hope to keep you up-to-date with the technology and help identify market opportunities. In this way, I hope that you too, can benefit from crypto.
