<p>I created a poll last week asking the community which coin I should write review next. RaiBlocks won with 40% of the vote. I’ve since spent several hours researching RaiBlocks and compiling everything I’ve learned in this article. I hope you find it helpful.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin’s price rose over 2017, so did fees required to use the network. Bitcoin Core developers have been against a block-size increase and are promising that the Lightning network will solve the fee problem. However, there are many uncertainties with the Lightning network including when it will be released and mass adopted.</p>

<p>This Bitcoin fee fiasco has generated significant interest in other cryptocurrencies with low fees and fast transaction times. RaiBlocks just so happens to be a prime candidate. As Bitcoin’s market cap dominance dropped from 60% to 33%, alternative cryptocurrencies saw large increases in marketcap and RaiBlocks was one of them. From a price under $0.20 at the start of December, RaiBlocks’ price skyrocketed to almost $35 at its peak and is now stabilizing at around $22.</p>

<p>One reason for this rise is the claim that RaiBlocks can support near instant and free transactions with unlimited throughput capacity while being sufficiently decentralized. This, of course, raises many people’s eyebrows since the best property of cryptocurrencies, decentralization, has always meant shitty scalability.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into RaiBlocks to see what it is, how it works, and whether it’s actually decentralized. We’ll also look at ecosystem factors like it’s team, investors, etc.</p>

<h1 id="feet-summary">10,000 feet summary</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Started in 2014. The main net was launched in 2017 and it’s fully functional.</li>
  <li>Fixed, maximum supply of 133,248,289 RaiBlocks. All RaiBlocks has been released.</li>
  <li>0 transaction fee, unlimited throughput capacity, &gt; 5 second confirmation time.</li>
  <li>Uses a block-lattice data structure instead of the blockchain.</li>
  <li>Consensus is maintained through a voting mechanism. Votes = # of raiblocks owned and delegated.</li>
  <li>RaiBlocks didn’t conduct an ICO. RaiBlocks was distributed through a faucet. 7,000,000 RaiBlocks retained for dev funds.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="-center" style="width: 700px" src="https://i.imgur.com/azcmAlx.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="is-raiblocks-a-scam">Is RaiBlocks a scam?</h1>

<p>I’ve scoured through the whitepaper and looked over the team’s history and believe that RaiBlocks is everything it claims, with a few caveats. There are many open questions around RaiBlocks’s consensus algorithm. It’s not well tested and to my understanding, lacks peer review.</p>

<p>Although RaiBlocks in its current state does indeed support near instant and free transactions with unlimited throughput capacity, the jury is still out on whether the consensus algorithm is correct and robust.</p>

<h1 id="how-does-raiblocks-work">How does RaiBlocks work?</h1>

<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies that use a traditional blockchain datastructure, RaiBlocks uses a novel data structure known as a block-lattice. While the blockchain consists of a singular global chain of blocks, every RaiBlocks account has its own blockchain.</p>

<p>The only account that can publish a transaction to an account’s blockchain is the account itself.</p>

<p>To send funds, the sender needs to issue a “send” transaction in its own blockchain, and the receiver needs to issue a corresponding “receive” transaction in its own blockchain. This is why it’s so fast. An account can very quickly update its own blockchain. These transactions are propagated across the network and as long as no validator discovers a conflict, the transaction is, for all intents and purposes, considered confirmed.</p>

<p>The RaiBlocks network consists of wallets and validator nodes. Wallets send transactions to a validator node, and the node first validates the transactions by checking them against their internal state of the network. The node then passes along the transaction to all other validator nodes its connected to. Every subsequent node performs the same sequence of action until the whole network has seen the transactions.</p>

<p>A validator node keeps track of the state of the entire network by storing the blockchains of every single RaiBlocks address. Conflicts or “forks” happen when a published transaction conflicts with the internal state of a validator node. To resolve the conflict, the node initiates a voting process by announcing the conflict to other validator nodes. The voting process occurs over a predefined period where each node votes on a state of the network it believes is correct. The number of votes a node has equals the amount of RaiBlocks it owns + votes delegated from other accounts. When a state has more than 133,248,289/2 votes (133,248,289 is the total number of XRBs in existence), it’s automatically accepted as the real state of the network.</p>

<p>The network provides no rewards for running a RaiBlocks validator.</p>

<p>To mitigate spam, an account needs to perform easy proof of work to add a transaction to its own blockchain. This is, of course, not a cure all as transactions can still be created within a few seconds.</p>

<h1 id="raiblocks-team-and-history">RaiBlocks team and history</h1>

<p>The key developer behind RaiBlocks is Colin LeMahieu. LeMahieu started developing RaiBlocks in 2014 and the network was released in 2017. RaiBlocks didn’t hold an ICO and instead distributed the cryptocurrency through a faucet on a website. Users need only complete a captcha in order to receive RaiBlocks.</p>

<p>The team behind RaiBlocks is small and fairly unknown but with the cryptocurrency’s recent success, LeMahieu is in the process of building a larger development team in order to cultivate a stronger ecosystem around RaiBlocks.</p>

<p><img class="-center" style="width: 700px" src="https://i.imgur.com/L3bJAEW.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="paypal-lead-engineer--raiblocks">PayPal lead engineer + RaiBlocks</h1>

<p>It’s interesting to note that a lead PayPal engineer built a checkout app for RaiBlocks as a weekend hack project and wrote about it on <a href="https://medium.com/@bluepnume/introducing-brainblocks-my-weekend-hack-project-to-build-a-simple-checkout-app-for-raiblocks-5f5770c06c14">Medium</a>. For a lead PayPal engineer to be interested in RaiBlocks to actually built something on it, even if it was just a “weekend hack project”, is quite significant for this nascent cryptocurrency.</p>

<h1 id="raiblocks-vs-iota">RaiBlocks vs IOTA</h1>

<p>Another cryptocurrency that also offers near instant and free transactions with high scalability is IOTA. IOTA has been extremely “hot” recently with prices skyrocketing from under a $1 to more than $5. It’s not surprising that IOTA is frequently compared to RaiBlocks. Here’s how the two cryptocurrencies differ.</p>

<p>IOTA, like RaiBlocks, offers near instant and free transactions. However, the two systems are very different. IOTA uses a DAG data structure (called Tangle) where every node in the graph represents one whole transaction. In order to issue a new transaction, an account needs to validate two previous transactions through proof of work. The new transaction would then “reference” or connect to the two previous transactions in the Tangle.</p>

<p>In IOTA, transactions happen in a single phase and is stored in the global Tangle. In RaiBlocks, transactions happen in two parts: a “send” transaction in the sender’s blockchain and a “receive” transaction in the receiver’s blockchain.</p>

<p>One major advantage RaiBlocks has over IOTA is in decentralization. IOTA currently needs a centralized Coordinator to ensure network security and direct network progress. This is because IOTA’s network security is directly tied to the amount of transactions occuring in the network. In low transaction conditions, transactions take longer to confirm and the network becomes more vulnerable to attacks. In theory, the Coordinator will eventually become unnecessary as the network reaches a critical mass of adoption but IOTA is far from this reality. A scary consequence of the Coordinator is the fact that IOTA’s developers can, and has, frozen user funds at a whim (<a href="https://blog.iota.org/official-iota-foundation-response-to-the-digital-currency-initiative-at-the-mit-media-lab-part-1-72434583a2">source</a>).</p>

<p>The security of RaiBlocks’s network, on the other hand, does not depend on the amount of transactions going through it. As such, RaiBlocks currently doesn’t need a centralized entity as a crutch to be secure.</p>

<p>IOTA has an ecosystem advantage over RaiBlocks. IOTA has more users and the IOTA Foundation has more business connections. For example, the Foundation recently launched an IOTA Data Marketplace initiative with many large companies participating.</p>

<h1 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h1>

<h2 id="questions-around-the-consensus-algorithm">Questions around the consensus algorithm</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, there are many open questions around the consensus algorithm. Given that RaiBlocks is so young, it is not well tested and lacks peer review. The risk is definitely real that there is a fatal flaw in the consensus algorithm. For example, what happens if there are not enough votes for a quorum in order to resolve a network conflict? Currently validator nodes rely on the maximum supply number (133,248,289) to determine a quorum and there definitely could be instances where not enough validator nodes participate in the voting process.</p>

<p>Another big question is in the event the RaiBlocks network gets separated for a long period of time (perhaps due to network issues or other freak occurences), what happens when you rejoin the two networks? Will the network be crippled from all the voting processes that would inevitably take place? Is there a mathematical guarantee that the network will recover?</p>

<h2 id="spam-vulnerability">Spam vulnerability</h2>

<p>RaiBlocks, being inherently feeless, is highly vulnerable to spam. I could run a script that simply has multiple accounts send transactions to each other continuously creating massive blockchains that could be a problem for validators. It costs almost nothing to create spam in the system yet can be incredibly costly. The storage costs of blockchain cryptocurrencies is predicatable based on block generation times and maximum block sizes. This is not the case with RaiBlocks.</p>

<p>Expect these spam attacks to occur as RaiBlocks increases in popularity and we will have to see how the development responds.</p>

<h2 id="raiblocks-doesnt-incentivize-decentralization">RaiBlocks doesn’t incentivize decentralization</h2>

<p>RaiBlocks validator nodes are quite expensive to run with high network throughput costs and modest processing and storage costs. Since there’s no reward for running a RaiBlocks validator node, validator node operators are prone to centralization.</p>

<p>Some people argue that businesses relying on the RaiBlocks network will be incentivized to run validator nodes to secure the network. Large investors might also be incentivized run validator nodes. However, we have yet to see if this is true.</p>

<h2 id="limited-applications---no-smart-contracts">Limited applications - no smart contracts</h2>

<p>It’s becoming increasingly clear how powerful smart contracts are and I have a strong feeling that the winning cryptocurrencies in the future must support smart contracts. RaiBlocks’s system is so novel and different that I wonder if smart contracts are even possible for RaiBlocks?</p>

<h1 id="bottomline">Bottomline</h1>

<p>RaiBlocks works as described - near instant and feeless transactions with unlimited transaction throughput. This cryptocurrency has a lot of promise and can be a serious challenge to big names like IOTA and even Bitcoin. However, RaiBlocks is currently being held back by an unproven consensus algorithm, spam vulnerability, and the lack of potential for smart contracts.</p>

        <p>In July 2010, one bitcoin was worth $0.08 USD. Today, one bitcoin is worth $2500 USD. Bitcoin's meteoric growth has pushed cryptocurrencies from an obscure niche to the mainstream, and created fortunes along the way. Store Of Value is a blog that will help you navigate the cryptocurrency world. As an avid crypto researcher and a crypto day-trader, I hope to keep you up-to-date with the technology and help identify market opportunities. In this way, I hope that you too, can benefit from crypto.
